Mutigaming core application

##What is MGio
Is a context agnostic multiplayer gaming framework. Uses the gRPC protocol for the exchange of events and actions.

The main idea of MGio is to allow developers to have a robust multiplayer framework that can be integrated easily with their games.

It will be compatible with unity initially, but the idea is to allow gRPC examples for the main major gaming languages.

##Why gRPC?
Framework agnosticity. Once the proto file is available, the developer can create its own implementation of gRPC in order to follow the flow of the framework.
Real time exchange
